For my final project, I am buidling a program that calculates the users BMR. 
A persons BMR or Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories the body needs to consume to function.
When trying to lose, gain, or maintain weight knowing your BMR is crucial. 
This program will take the users details and using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation will give them their BMR.
So far, I have coded the most important aspects of the program like the user inputs and logic that the calculator uses.
I plan to expand this program by adding features like a diary where the user can track how much calories they've consumed that day
and a feature where they can search for common foods and their calories.
I would also love to implement a simple UI for this program.
